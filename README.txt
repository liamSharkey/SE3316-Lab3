This app isnt entirely functional
 
the user authentication works really well with password auth and new user creation and entry into the DB
(i only found out afterwards this wasnt necessary)

The admin login is email: wsharke@uwo.ca and password: 123

when in the "myMeetings" tab, a user can add a new meeting although preferences cannot be set in into

i couldnt finish but i hope you like what i got :/
